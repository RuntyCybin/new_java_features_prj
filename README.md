# new_java_features_prj
project that checks the benefits of jdk 21
"main" branch contains a basic default version of the project just with the simple record of Person

In this branch we are going to review the Sealed interfaces
Our sealed interface is going to be Person and the classes that can implment it are:
- Employee
- Customer
To test totally how sealed interfaces work I was needed to use a new Switch which contains a patter matching
To try this new switch the project JDK version was increased to 21
